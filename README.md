### The Eco Shell Marathon

This year, I joined the Eco Motion Team, which participates annually in the Shell Marathon, a demanding European competition organized by Shell. The challenge requires students to design, build, and drive ultra-energy-efficient vehicles. Polytech Nancy has participated in this event for 25 years, with over 400 engineering students contributing, often breaking numerous records.

As a member of the continuous improvement group, my project focused on designing and optimizing the dashboard of our competition vehicle, the "PolyWatt." A key feature of the dashboard is a mobile phone that runs our custom app. This app connects to a specific website, enabling us to track the car, monitor our performance, and replay races to analyze our energy consumption.
